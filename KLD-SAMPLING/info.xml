        <briefdescription>
	This code implements Dieter Fox's KLD-sampling algorithm (KLD stands for Kullback-Leibler distance).

        <description>
	When using particle filters to approximate an unknown
	distribution, too few particles may not adequately sample the
	underlying distribution, while too many samples can increase
	the run time of time sensitive programs (e.g. particle filter
	localization for a mobile robot). Running this program
	demonstrates how different KLD-sampling parameters affect both
	the number of samples and the estimated mean and variance of
	the underlying distribution. This sample program assumes a 1D
	underlying distribution, but the provided KLD-sampling module
	works on multivariate distributions.
